# Order of Magnitude Economics and Scaling

This chapter introduces you to the core of **ecological economics** (EE) - thinking in terms of scale and constraints.
This kind of thinking is very much inspired by how natural scientists, in particular physicists and mathematicians, think and this is no coincidence because much of ecological economics was developed by mathematicians like [Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen) or physicists like [Robert Ayres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ayres_(scientist)) who intended to put economics within thermodynamic constraints. 

Moreover the issue of scale and scaling is fundamental in physics, too. Indeed much of classical physics, say the Newtonian principles of gravity, can be understood as a kind of scaling law (because, for example, the strength of gravitation reduces with distance squared which is a scaling exponent). In order to read up on this kind stuff you can for instance have a look at the book Scale by Geoffry West which also relates to some of the topics we treat here.

However, important to me as an educator is that ecological economics still is about economics. Hence we will not only discuss the ecological scale of production and consumption but also connect to several examples from, say, more conventional micro and macro economics.
