## 1. Who Is This Book For?

## 2. Philosophy & Approach to Ecological Economics
This is book is a quantitative introduction to ecological economics. It emphasizes not only quantitative, computational methods and thinking but also a systems perspective and ideas from complexity science as well. 

Its goal is to equip the student of this book with a quantitative and computational mind-set for ecological economics and the wider sustainability sciences.

Ecological economics is a very varied field and there also different approaches one can take to it than this book does. 

For example, some researchers and educators might miss qualitative methods. This is correct and can (and should) be found in other books but will not constitute a major part of this book.

This book also cuts short on many normative ideas from ecological economics. For example the distinction between environmental economics and ecological economics is often drawn along the lines of weak and strong sustainability. Whereby strong sustainability stands for the viewpoint that nature is non-substitutable and cannot be transformed into economic goods of equal value. This is important for understanding the history and many contemporary viewpoints in Ecological Economics. 

However, my interests lie primarily in developing tools for thinking rigorously and efficiently about global, national and regional problems and provide students with such tools of mind. 

In that regard, this book might seem rather positivist but I encourage educators to complement this book with other teaching materials if they feel so.
