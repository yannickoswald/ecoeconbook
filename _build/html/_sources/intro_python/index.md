# Introduction to Python and Programming

Welcome!  
This short chapter gets you writing and *running* Python code right away, then introduces core concepts like variables, data types, collections, control flow, and functions—using tiny examples from **ecological economics** (EE).

By the end, you’ll build a simple coding project - we will analyse a dataframe of countries and their resource use!

:::{tip}
**What you’ll learn**
- How to run code cells in this book
- Python as a calculator (numbers, operators)
- Variables, basic data types, and printing
- Lists & dictionaries (for small datasets)
- `if` statements and `for` loops
- Functions, arguments, outputs
- A tiny EE project: compute national CO₂ emissions and per-capita values
